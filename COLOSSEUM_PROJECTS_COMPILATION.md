## ⚠️ SCRAPING LIMITATION NOTICE

**Why this list is incomplete:**

The Colosseum website uses modern JavaScript frameworks (likely React/Vue) that render content dynamically. This means:

1. **Standard web scraping fails** - Content loads after JavaScript execution
2. **Browser automation required** - Would need Puppeteer/Playwright
3. **API access needed** - Colosseum doesn't appear to have a public API
4. **Authentication barriers** - Some content may require login

**Recommended approach for full list:**
- Manual browsing: https://colosseum.com/agent-hackathon/projects
- Use browser dev tools to inspect network requests
- Check if Colosseum provides CSV/JSON export for judges

## 💡 COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS

### Aethernaut Positioning

**Unique Differentiators**:

2. **Three-pillar architecture** - Treasury + Agents + Markets integrated
3. **Polymarket-style UI** - Professional prediction markets
4. **Security hardened** - Audit completed with fixes applied
5. **Production ready** - Live deployment with all features working

**Comparison to Featured Projects**:
